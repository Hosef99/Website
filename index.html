						Since 2018, I've built a strong foundation in web
						development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've
						developed an intermediate level of expertise over time,
						creating dynamic and engaging web pages. I'm constantly
						learning and staying updated with the latest trends,
						particularly in CSS, where I experiment with diverse
						styles and layouts for visually appealing and responsive
						websites.

					<br />
					<p>
						Game development is another area where I have honed my
						skills. I have been using Unity alongside with C# since
						2021 to bring captivating gaming experiences to life. I
						designed many games and joined game jams, with many
						experience with implementing physics and audio.

					<h3>Watch My Nucleus</h3>
					<p>
						Using Unity as the game engine and C# as the primary
						programming language, my team and I were able to create
						Watch my Nucleus in just 72 hours for the Ludum Dare 49
						Game Jam. As the developer, I also composed the game's
						music using FL Studio 20. Despite the tight time frame,
						we were able to produce a physics simulation game that
						performed well and was well received by players. With
						2939 game submissions, Watch my Nucleus was able to
						secure an outstanding placement of 61st place in the
						"Theme" category and 178th place in the "Audio"
						category.

					<h3>Mask Throw</h3>
					<p>
						As the creator of "Mask Throw," I had the opportunity to
						work alongside a friend to bring this simple 2D puzzle
						game to life. I took on the responsibility of designing
						and implementing the game mechanics and physics,
						ensuring that the player would have a fun and engaging
						experience while playing. In addition, I had the
						pleasure of crafting the game's music and sound effects,
						which played a vital role in creating the game's overall
						atmosphere and mood. It was an exciting and rewarding
						experience to see our hard work come together in the
						final product.

						I had the opportunity to work on an A* Pathfinding

						In my experience as a musician, I have had the
						opportunity to work on numerous music projects, with a

						requirements of different game types and genres. As a
						result, I have developed a diverse range of music
						composition skills, which allow me to create music in
						different styles, including orchestral, electronic, and
						ambient. Moreover, I enjoy exploring new methods to
						create music sets that share a common motive, enhancing
						the overall mood and atmosphere of the game.
